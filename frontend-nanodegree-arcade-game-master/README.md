## About the project
 
  This is a project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Schoolarship and has only learning purpose. The students are given a starter project that includes art assets and also JS code for the game engine. Students have to build the game, add functionality (basic and optional functionality) according to the project instructions.
  I've changed a little the style and rules of the game and transformed the classic FROGGER into an ICE AGE style FROGGER
  
## Instructions

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:

To run the game you just open the index.html file or visit this page: https://iuliaelizas.github.io/Frogger-Arcade-Game-/.
IMPORTANT: For now the game can be played only on devices with keyboard.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

In this game you have a Player and Enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the earth, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the ice. Once  the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. There are also collectibles that can be collected by the player, but no more than one at a time. The collectibles are counted only if the player reaches the earth after he collected the item. The player has 3 minutes and 3 lives to collect as many collectibles as possible.

At the end of the game the player recives a message that tells him the number of collected items.
